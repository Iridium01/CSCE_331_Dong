            <h2> Hey! My Name is Kane Dong.</h2>
            <p>I am a junior CS + Statistics double major at Texas A&M University. </p>
            <p>I am currently doing bioinformatics research on the <i>M. tuberculosis</i> genome in Dr. Thomas Ioerger's lab.</p>
            <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy playing sports like ultimate frisbee, bouldering, and badminton!</p>
            <!-- <p>Beyond academics and research, I am passionate about using programming and data analysis to build solutions that make complex information more accessible. Whether it's creating financial literacy tools like the web app I developed at TAMUhack or applying bioinformatics to understand drug resistance, I enjoy taking on challenging problems that require innovative, data-driven solutions.</p>
            <p>Outside of my academic and technical pursuits, I enjoy staying active and participating in sports such as ultimate frisbee, badminton, and bouldering. These activities have taught me valuable lessons in teamwork, leadership, and resilience. I also immerse myself with on-campus organizations. Currently, I am the Vice President External of the Chinese Student Association, where I network with other organizations, especially asian socio-cultural groups, in order to share and celebrate chinese culture.</p>
            <p>I am always eager to learn and grow, whether it's through new programming languages, advanced statistical methods, or cross-disciplinary projects. I am deeply committed to contributing to impactful work that drives positive change, and I am excited to continue developing my skills and knowledge to make a meaningful impact in the world of data science and technology.</p>
            <p>After graduation, I aim to pursue a PhD in bioinformatics or computational biology to deepen my expertise in the intersection of data science and biology, with a focus on pharmaceutical research. My goal is to develop and apply advanced computational methods to better understand complex biological systems, particularly in the context of drug discovery and development. I envision using bioinformatics tools to identify novel therapeutic targets, optimize drug efficacy, and combat resistance to existing treatments.</p> -->

            <h3>Ultimate Frisbee</h3>
            <p>I have been playing ultimate frisbee recreationally for the past 3 years. If you don't know, ultimate frisbee is a seven-on-seven sport similar to soccer. There are two endzones at opposite ends of the field and your goal is to pass the frisbee to the other team's endzone.</p>
            <p>In these past few years, I have participated in multiple intramural tournaments and my team has consistently placed on the podium each time. This year, I've started going to practices hosted by the TAMU club team in an effort to improve my own skills and try out for the TAMU club ultimate team.</p>

            <h3>Bouldering</h3>
            <p>I've been bouldering since senior year of high school. It's become somewhat therapeutic now as I go to the gym and distract myself with multicolored plastic holds. Currently I'm a V4-5 climber and I've started to work on my strength/endurance and pay closer attention to my footwork in order to progress up the grades.</p>
            <p>I think climbing is a great way to stay active and a solid alternative to the traditional cardio/weight-lifting regimens. Of course, doing these things can improve your performance on the wall, but for those who are just looking to stay healthy, climbing is a unique alternative.</p>
            <p>I also believe that climbing is for everyone. Even if you regularly work out and stay active, climbing is a great way to test your functional strength. After all, what's the point of having big muscles if you can't hang for a minute. It's a great way to strengthen your tendons and smaller muscle groups, improve balance and coordination, and be able to open any jar with your insane grip strength!</p>
