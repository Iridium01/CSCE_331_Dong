            <h2> Hey! My Name is Kane Dong.</h2>
            <p>I am a junior CS + Statistics double major at Texas A&M University. </p>
            <p>I am currently doing bioinformatics research on the <i>M. tuberculosis</i> genome in Dr. Thomas Ioerger's lab.</p>
            <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy playing sports like ultimate frisbee, bouldering, and badminton!</p>
            <!-- <p>Beyond academics and research, I am passionate about using programming and data analysis to build solutions that make complex information more accessible. Whether it's creating financial literacy tools like the web app I developed at TAMUhack or applying bioinformatics to understand drug resistance, I enjoy taking on challenging problems that require innovative, data-driven solutions.</p>
            <p>Outside of my academic and technical pursuits, I enjoy staying active and participating in sports such as ultimate frisbee, badminton, and bouldering. These activities have taught me valuable lessons in teamwork, leadership, and resilience. I also immerse myself with on-campus organizations. Currently, I am the Vice President External of the Chinese Student Association, where I network with other organizations, especially asian socio-cultural groups, in order to share and celebrate chinese culture.</p>
            <p>I am always eager to learn and grow, whether it's through new programming languages, advanced statistical methods, or cross-disciplinary projects. I am deeply committed to contributing to impactful work that drives positive change, and I am excited to continue developing my skills and knowledge to make a meaningful impact in the world of data science and technology.</p>
            <p>After graduation, I aim to pursue a PhD in bioinformatics or computational biology to deepen my expertise in the intersection of data science and biology, with a focus on pharmaceutical research. My goal is to develop and apply advanced computational methods to better understand complex biological systems, particularly in the context of drug discovery and development. I envision using bioinformatics tools to identify novel therapeutic targets, optimize drug efficacy, and combat resistance to existing treatments.</p> -->
